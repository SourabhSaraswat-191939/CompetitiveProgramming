# The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is considered as an example of \
# the divide and conquer strategy. So, in this algorithm, the array is initially divided \
# into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner. We can think of it \
# as a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be \
# further divided. This means that if the array becomes empty or has only one element left,\ 
# the dividing will stop, i.e. it is the base case to stop the recursion. If the array has \
# multiple elements, we split the array into halves and recursively invoke the merge sort \
# on each of the halves. Finally, when both the halves are sorted, the merge operation is \
# applied. Merge operation is the process of taking two smaller sorted arrays and combining \
# them to eventually make a larger one.


#  T.C. -> T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n) = O(nlogn) in all cases (best,avg,worst)   Aux.S.C. -> O(N)
