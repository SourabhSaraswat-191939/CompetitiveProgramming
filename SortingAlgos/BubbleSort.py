# Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping \
# the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable \
# for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

# in this we are fixing 1 element after each iteration, i.e. the last element of array.
# It is optimized by stopping the algorithm if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap. 

#  T.C. -> O(N^2)      S.C. -> O(1)
